            "Being a Mom is about so much more than feeding, dressing, and driving our kids to play-dates. With only a few short years to impart important spiritual truths to our children, every day becomes an eternal opportunity for teaching, training, and modeling Christlikeness. The Disciple-Making Mom session will give mothers the tools they need to disciple their children in the most important areas of prayer, service, Bible study, scripture memorization, and true fellowship. Moms will walk away encouraged and strengthened, knowing that although discipling their children seems a huge task, God is on their side!"
